**Reasoning-**
The solution uses the linked list data structure to link each block to the next and append a new block in constant time to the last one.

**Time-Complexity-**
- To append the new block in blockchain the complexity is - O(1)
- To list all the blocks in blockchain the complexity is - O(n)

**Space Complexity -**
- Since adding each new block requires a new block in memory, the space complexity is - O(n) where n represent the memory required by each block.
