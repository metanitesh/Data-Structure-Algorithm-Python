**Reasoning-**
The solution check against last min or max to keep track of the minimum and maximum element in the list.

**Time-Complexity-**
The time complexity for the solution is O(n) where n is the number of items in the list.

**Space Complexity -**
The space complexity of the solution is O(n) where n the number of items in the list
