**Reasoning-**
The solution uses merge sort to solve the problem within specified complexity O(nlogn).

**Time-Complexity-**
The time complexity for the solution is O(nlogn) + O(n) where n represent the number of elements in the list. Since the nlogn is the bigger number, worse case complexity is of order O(nlogn)

**Space Complexity -**
Space complexity for the solution is of order O(n) where n represent the number of element in the list. since merge sort function require space complexity of O(n)
