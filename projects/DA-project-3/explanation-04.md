**Reasoning-**
The solution set all the 0's in front and all the 2's in last, and all the 1's automatically appears in middle.

**Time-Complexity-**
The time complexity for the solution is O(n) where n is the number of items in the list.

**Space Complexity -**
The space complexity of the solution is O(1)
